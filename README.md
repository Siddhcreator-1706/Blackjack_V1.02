# 🃏 BLACKJACK

This is a Qt-based Blackjack game built in C++. It uses object-oriented principles and graphical components from Qt (e.g., QGraphicsView, QGraphicsScene, QPushButton) to create an interactive card game GUI.
![Game_Screenshot](cloner.jpg)

The term "Blackjack" specifically refers to a natural 21:
A two-card hand consisting of an Ace (valued at 11) and any 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, or King).


## ✨ Why Is It Special?

- Combines luck, **probability, and **strategic decision-making
- Offers one of the lowest house edges in a casino if played optimally
- A game where player choices actually matter
# 🎯 Quick Game Rules (Read First!)

**Objective:** Beat the dealer by getting your card total as close to 21 as possible — without going over.

### 🕹️ How to Play
1. **Start Game** → You and dealer get 2 cards.
2. **Your Turn:**
   - 🔘 **Hit** to draw another card.
   - 🔘 **Stand** to end your turn.
3. **Dealer’s Turn:**
   - Dealer draws until score ≥ 17.
4. **Result:** Closest to 21 wins.
   - Over 21 = **Bust** ❌ 
   - Equal scores = **Tie** 🤝

### 💰 Double Down - When and Why?
- **Best Used:** When your first two cards total 9, 10, or 11
- **Why?** Great chance to get 21 while doubling your potential win!
- **Risk:** You commit to taking only one more card

### 🧠 Examples
**Example 1: Regular Play**
| Hand         | Cards            | Score |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Player       | A♠, 9♦           | 20    |
| Dealer       | K♣, 7♣, 5♠       | 22    (Bust) |
| ➤ **Player Wins** |

**Example 2: Double Down Success**
| Action       | Cards            | Score | Bet  |
|--------------|------------------|-------|------|
| Initial      | 5♣, 6♥           | 11    | $10  |
| Double Down  | + 8♦             | 19    | $20  |
| Dealer       | J♠, 7♠           | 17    |      |
| ➤ **Player Wins $40!** |

**Example 3: Double Down Risk**
| Action       | Cards            | Score | Bet  |
|--------------|------------------|-------|------|
| Initial      | Q♦, 2♠           | 12    | $10  |
| Double Down  | + 9♣             | 21    | $20  |
| Dealer       | A♠, K♦           | 21    |      |
| ➤ **Tie - Bet Returned** |

## 📂 Project Structure & File Roles

| File         | Role |
|--------------|------|
| card.h / cpp | Defines a Card class — suit, rank, value, and GUI representation. |
| deck.h / cpp | Manages a 52-card deck: creation, shuffling, and drawing. |
| gameboard.h / cpp | Core gameplay logic and GUI layout: user interaction, scoring, and results. |
| main.cpp     | Launches the application with a GameBoard view. |

---

## Qt Signals and Slots: Event Flow

Qt uses signals and slots to handle user interaction. When a user clicks a button, a signal is emitted. A slot is a method that's executed in response.

| UI Element      | Signal         | Slot Function     | Action Performed           |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Hit Button      | `clicked()`    | `playerHit()`     | Player draws a card        |
| Stand Button    | `clicked()`    | `playerStand()`   | Dealer plays, then result  |
| Restart Button  | `clicked()`    | `restartGame()`   | Resets the board and deck  |

These are connected using:
```cpp
connect(hitButton, SIGNAL(clicked()), this, SLOT(playerHit()));
connect(standButton, SIGNAL(clicked()), this, SLOT(playerStand()));
connect(restartButton, SIGNAL(clicked()), this, SLOT(restartGame()));
```

## 🧼 Data Structures: Used vs Suggested

### ✔️ Data Structures Used in the Code

| Structure             | Purpose                                           | Why It Was Chosen         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `std::vector<Card*>`  | Store and manage dynamic card collections         | Resizable and random access |
| `QString`             | Hold suit/rank names                              | Required for Qt UI rendering |
| `QGraphicsScene`      | Graphics scene to place visual items              | Native to Qt framework      |
| `QGraphicsTextItem`   | Render card text and score labels                 | For graphical text display |

### 🌟 Suggested Improvements

| Alternative Structure | Recommended Usage             | Benefit |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| `std::deque<Card*>`   | Replace vector for Deck       | O(1) pop from front; more semantic deck draw behavior |
| `std::stack<Card*>`   | Draw cards from top of deck   | Enforces draw-only-top pattern, clearer intent |
| `std::array`           | For static full-deck setup    | Safer and faster fixed-size alternative to vector for 52 cards |
| `std::map<QString, int>` | Replace multiple ifs for card values | Cleaner value lookup for A, K, Q, J, etc. |

## 🧠 Data Structures: Before vs After (Made Super Simple)

| 🔴 *Before (Used in Code)*       | 🟢 *After (Suggested for Improvement)* | 💡 *Why It's Better (In Simple Words)*                                                   |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| std::vector<Card*> (for deck)    | std::deque<Card*>                      | You can *take cards from the front faster*, like drawing from the top of a real deck.     |
| std::vector<Card*> (draw cards)  | std::stack<Card*>                      | Makes it *clear* that you’re *only drawing from the top* — like a real card pile.       |
| std::vector (52-card setup)      | std::array<Card, 52>                   | A deck always has *52 cards* — using a fixed-size array is *safer* and a bit *faster*. |
| Many if statements for values    | std::map<QString, int>                 | Just *look up the value* like a dictionary: "K" → 10. Much *cleaner* and *easier*. |

## 🎨 Why Did We Choose Qt for Graphics?

Qt was selected as the GUI framework for this Blackjack project for the following key reasons:

- **Native Widget Toolkit**: Qt offers a comprehensive set of widgets that look and behave like native components across platforms.
- **Visual UI Designer**: Qt Creator provides a drag-and-drop interface (UI files) that saves development time and reduces boilerplate code.
- **Signal-Slot System**: Qt's built-in event-handling mechanism simplifies user interactions without managing low-level listeners.
- **Cross-Platform**: Code written once in Qt can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal changes.
- **Layout Management**: Built-in layout managers make the UI responsive and resolution-independent.

> 🔍 Compared to libraries like SDL or SFML (which are more suited to 2D games), Qt was better suited for a button-based UI and fast prototyping.

---

## 📦 Graphics and UI Features

-  Clean, modern main window with styled buttons (Hit, Stand, Double Down)
-  Card images displayed dynamically (optional: use QPixmap)
-  Real-time score updates for both player and dealer
-  Game status display (Win/Lose/Draw)
-  Responsive design with grid and vertical/horizontal layouts
-  Feedback via popups and labels for user decisions
-  Custom stylesheets for consistent theming

---

## 🧠 UI Design Decisions

- **Why not QML?**
  > While QML offers advanced animations and declarative syntax, we chose Qt Widgets (C++) for tighter integration with game logic and class-based architecture.

- **Why not SFML or OpenGL?**
  > These libraries are lower-level and best for graphics-heavy or animated 2D/3D games. Qt suits button-driven games with less need for rendering pipelines.

- **Manual vs Designer UI?**
  > Qt Designer was used for faster prototyping, but layouts were customized in code where dynamic elements were involved (e.g., card drawing).

## 🔧 Graphics Implementation Overview

| Component       | Qt Widget Used       | Description                                |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Game Area       | `QWidget`, `QVBoxLayout` | Contains the card display and controls     |
| Cards Display   | `QLabel` + `QPixmap` | Dynamically shows cards using image files  |
| Buttons         | `QPushButton`        | Hit, Stand, Double Down controls            |
| Score Panel     | `QLabel`             | Real-time display of current scores         |
| Status Display  | `QLabel`             | Displays Win/Loss/Draw                      |

## ⚖️ Limitations & Proposed Solutions

| Limitation | Problem | Suggested Fix |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| Deck can be overdrawn | Drawing from an empty deck causes crashes | Add a check before drawing a card |
| Code duplication when drawing cards | Same logic repeated for player and dealer | Use reusable helper function |

### ✅ Fix 1: Prevent drawing from empty deck
**Before:**
```cpp
Card* card = deck->drawCard();
playerHand.push_back(card);
```

**After:**
```cpp
if (deck->cardsLeft() > 0) {
    Card* card = deck->drawCard();
    playerHand.push_back(card);
}
```

### ✅ Fix 2: Reusable drawCardToHand function
**Before:**
```cpp
Card* card = deck->drawCard();
dealerHand.push_back(card);
scene->addItem(card);
```

**After:**
```cpp
void GameBoard::drawCardToHand(std::vector<Card*>& hand) {
    if (deck->cardsLeft() > 0) {
        Card* card = deck->drawCard();
        hand.push_back(card);
        scene->addItem(card);
    }
}
```
Usage:
```cpp
drawCardToHand(playerHand);
drawCardToHand(dealerHand);
```

# 🃏 Blackjack Realistic Dealer Card Reveal Enhancement 

## 🔍 What Changed?  
**Before:**  
Dealer's 2nd card was always visible (less realistic)  

**After:**  
Dealer's 2nd card stays hidden until their turn (like real casinos)  

---
## 🎯 Feature Overview
| Aspect          | Before Implementation | After Implementation |
|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Realism**     | All cards visible immediately | Hidden card mimics real casino play |
| **Suspense**    | No anticipation build-up | True-to-life reveal moment |
| **Code Structure** | Simple immediate reveal | Special handling for hidden card |

## 🛠 Implementation Code
```cpp
/* GameBoard Class Additions */
class GameBoard {
    // ... existing code ...
    Card* dealerHiddenCard = nullptr;  // Track the face-down card

    void dealInitialCards() {
        // Deal first card (visible)
        dealerHand.push_back(deck->drawCard());
        
        // Deal second card (hidden)
        dealerHiddenCard = deck->drawCard();
        dealerHand.push_back(dealerHiddenCard);  // Add to hand but don't display
        
        // ... player card dealing logic ...
    }

    void dealerPlay() {
        // Dramatic reveal before dealer starts playing
        scene->addItem(dealerHiddenCard->getText());
        dealerHiddenCard->getText()->setPos(150, 100);
        
        // ... rest of dealer turn logic ...
    }
};
```
